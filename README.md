# Predicting-Annual-Energy-Bill-Expenditure-and-Identifying-Financial-Struggles-with-Machine-Learning
Project Description:

The project aims to help energy company AENERGY predict customer struggles with paying increasing electricity costs using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical customer data, including demographic information, heating system details, and spending habits, the goal is to develop a predictive model to anticipate payment difficulties. AENERGY provides access to a training set of historical data with labels indicating recent payment issues for model development and evaluation.

In addition to predicting payment struggles, the project expands to include designing a system to forecast the annual variation in customer expenditure resulting from energy cost increases. AENERGY offers a training dataset with customer features and numerical values representing annual expenditure variations, accounting for both positive and negative changes.

Through machine learning methodologies and historical data insights, the project aims to provide AENERGY with actionable insights to better anticipate and address customer financial challenges amidst rising energy costs, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and financial stability.
